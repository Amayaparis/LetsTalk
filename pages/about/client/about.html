<p style="color:#426cb2"> The LetsTalk team developers had designed this application for the purpose of communication, togetherness, and the ability to be attentive. This app consists of news sources that would inspire and be of use to start and further develope the flow of discussions within the chat rooms. Users are able to gain points in their activity within the application such as joing and starting chat rooms. There is also a page in which the User may be able to view the stories that news outlets post and the events that go on. We ask that all discussions are created with open-mindedness in the spread of ideas and knowledge.</p>
